1. Home Screen Menu []

   - The item details UI is missing
     (Note: The API for retrieving items and item sizes is available)

2. Home Screen Tables []
   - The home screen table details API is missing. I need an API to retrieve items that have been ordered within a table. The following APIs are not available:
     -- Insert items into the table
     -- Display items that belong to the table
   - The Ordered Menu Screen UI logic requires updates. The "add" button should be displayed on item cards when the menu screen is navigated from the table details route. Additional edits are needed to display the item size in the popup.
   - The Order Table Invoice integration: The invoice API needs to be integrated to display the full invoice for the table.
     (Note: The API is not yet available, and there is a printing button in the UI. It is unclear whether this feature will be used)
